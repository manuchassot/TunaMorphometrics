## Sampling operations

Most sampling operations were conducted at tuna processing factories located in Abidjan (CÃ´te d'Ivoire) and Victoria (Seychelles) through agreements with the companies to comply with health and quality manufacturer practices and not delay processing operations [@Marsac2006; @Chassot2014]. Access to the canneries and processing lines varied over time according to management policy and staff availability, which resulted in unbalanced sampling design (**Table 1**). In complement, some tunas were sampled during tagging and recovery operations conducted as per the Indian Ocean Regional Tuna Tagging Programme [IO-RTTP; @Murua2015] and throughout some research projects conducted on the ecology of tropical tuna in the region [@Bodin2018].

## Sampling protocol

For each fish, the species was identified based on meristic and morphometric traits and the sex determined from visual examination of the gonads [@Collette1983]. All fish from processing factories were defrosted prior to sampling for length and weight (**Table X**). Length measurements were taken with a calliper in most cases and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm while total weights were measured with a 150 kg scale. Tuna collected during the IO-RTTP were sampled fresh at sea and measured with a measuring board while total weights were measured with spring scales.

## Fish traceability

Traceability corresponds to the ability of accurately and precisely determining the origin of the fish sampled, i.e., the geographic location and date when the fish was caught at sea. Hence, traceability depends on the information recorded and available throughout the production process, from fishing to processing.

The origin of each fish sampled was derived from the information recorded and available at each stage of the production process, i.e., first from the processing factory and second, from the fishing industry.

The fishing vessel and date of unloading were systematically recorded by the processing factories, making it possible to identify the fishing trip of origin of the fish sampled. In Abidjan, the wells of

## Quality control

Data stored in Tunabio database are systematically checked for integrity. Consistency, validation and formatting controls are carried out when entering the data. Errors can be made at the time of transcription and data entry. Data are therefore controlled with charts, comparison of values, or by checking the timeline for the dates. A correction is made on the basis of the physical data entry sheets on which the data are recorded during the sampling.
