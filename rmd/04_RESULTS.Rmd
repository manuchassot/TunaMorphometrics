## Tuna origin

Overall, the minimum level of traceability achieved was found to be of the order of magnitude of a typical purse seiner's fishing trip. In the Atlantic Ocean, 90% of the samples with information on fish origin had a range of capture dates less than 32 days (**Fig. \@ref(fig:SamplesCaptureDateUncertainty)**). In the Indian Ocean, the range of uncertainty on fishing dates was less than 30 days for 98% of the samples.
