Morphometric data are instrumental in fish ecology to (i) standardize different types of measurements collected from various sources (e.g., fishermen, scientific observers at sea), (ii) estimate biomass from length observations since the collection of precise and accurate data on fish weight is generally difficult for logistical reasons, and (iii) derive condition factors aimed at measuring the energetic status of some species [@Ricker1975; @Bolger1989]. In particular, morphometric relationships and conversion factors are widely used to derive fishery-specific size distributions for stock assessment models, estimate sampling and reporting rates, and track changes in size-based indicators (e.g., average weight in the catch). Biased or inappropriate morphometric relationships have been shown to affect knowledge on the size structure of the catch with potential impacts on stock assessments [@Gerritsen2007;@MinteVera2016]. Furthermore, in some mixed fisheries, the species composition of the catch in weight may be estimated from the conversion of samples of fish size [@Pianet2000; @Duparc2020], with potential major impacts on the estimates of species-specific catches if length-weight relationships are biased [@Marsac2017].

Purse seine fishing has represented about 70% of the global tropical tuna catch over the last decade, with an estimate of more than 3.6 million metric tons in 2019. In the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, the purse seine catch of the principal market tunas, yellowfin tuna (_Thunnus albacares_), skipjack tuna (_Katsuwonus pelamis_) and bigeye tuna (_Thunnus obesus_), was close to 800,000 metric tons in recent years. The species composition of most purse seine catch of the Indian and Atlantic is estimated from size samples of the catch performed during unloading operations that mainly take place in the ports of Abidjan (CÃ´te d'Ivoire), Dakar (Senegal), and Victoria (Seychelles) [@Pianet2000]. The collection of morphometric data on tuna has been implemented in these landing ports as early as the 1970s to derive the morphometric relationships required for the monitoring of purse seine fisheries occurring in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Guillou et al. _submitted_).

The overarching objective of the present study is to derive length-length and length-weight relationships for the principal market tropical tunas caught with purse seine in the Atlantic and Indian oceans based on a large data set of morphometric data collected through different research projects and monitoring programs since the mid-1970s. The study also aims to analyse the variability of length-weight relationships and compare the life-histoy traits of tropical tunas between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
