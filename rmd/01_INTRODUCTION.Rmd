<!-- The monitoring of the biology and ecology of oceanic pelagic species such as tunas is challenged by their wide spatial distribution, large-scale movements, and long lifespan. Basin-scale sampling of large pelagics through scientific surveys and fisheries observer programs is limited in space and time because of high costs and logistical issues. The advent of biologging technology over the two last decades has provided a large body of information on individual animal movements and behaviour in the wild and more recently some insight into the physiological mechanisms driving migrations [@Bograd2010;@Whitlock2015]. Nevertheless, the collection of data and samples on functional traits, reproductive biology, and trophic ecology of tunas (e.g., gonad, stomach contents, etc.) generally requires the handling of fish that can not be performed at sea without affecting their survival. -->

Morphometric data are widely used to derive conversion factors and relationships in order to (i) standardize different types of measurements collected on fish from various sources (e.g., fishermen, scientific observers at sea), (ii) estimate biomass from length observations since the collection of precise and accurate data on fish weight is generally difficult for logistical reasons, and (iii) derive condition factors aimed at measuring the energetic status of fish [@Ricker1975; @Bolger1989]. Morphometric relationships are instrumental in the processing of fisheries data to estimate sampling and reporting rates, track changes in size-based indicators (e.g., average weight in the catch), and derive fishery-specific size distributions required for most stock assessment models. Biased or inappropriate morphometric relationships have been shown to affect knowledge on the size structure of the catch with potential impacts on stock assessments [@Gerritsen2007;@MinteVera2016]. Furthermore, in some mixed fisheries, the species composition of the catch in weight may be estimated from the conversion of samples of fish size, with potential major impacts on the estimates of species-specific catches if length-weight relationships are biased.

Purse seine fishing has represented about 70% of the global tropical tuna catch over the last decade, with an estimate of more than 3.6 million metric tons in 2019. In the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, the purse seine catch of the principal market tunas, yellowfin tuna (_Thunnus albacares_), skipjack tuna (_Katsuwonus pelamis_) and bigeye tuna (_Thunnus obesus_), was close to 800,000 metric tons in recent years. Purse seiners also catch albacore tuna (_Thunnus alalunga_) to a lesser extent when they occur in mixed schools with tropical tunas. The species composition of most purse seine catch of the Indian and Atlantic is estimated from size samples of the catch performed during unloading operations that mainly take place in the ports of Abidjan (CÃ´te d'Ivoire), Dakar (Senegal), and Victoria (Seychelles) [@Pianet2000]. The collection of morphometric data on tuna has been implemented as early as the 1970s to derive the morphometric relationships required for the monitoring of purse seine fisheries occurring in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Guillou et al. _submitted_).

The present study aims to derive length-length and length-weight relationships for the principal market tropical tunas and albacore tuna caught with purse seine in the Atlantic and Indian oceans based on the morphometric data sets collected in the principal fishing ports where tuna is landed.
