# Introduction

Morphometric data are instrumental in fish ecology to (i) standardize different types of measurements collected from various sources (e.g., fishermen, scientific observers at sea), (ii) estimate biomass from length observations since the collection of precise and accurate data on fish weight is generally difficult for logistical reasons, and (iii) derive condition factors aimed at measuring the energetic status of fish [@Ricker1975; @Bolger1989]. In fisheries science, morphometric relationships and conversion factors are widely used to derive fishery-specific size distributions for stock assessment models, estimate sampling and reporting rates as well as raising factors for extrapolation, and track changes in size-based indicators (e.g., average weight in the catch). Biased or inappropriate morphometric relationships have been shown to affect knowledge on the size structure of the catch with potential impacts on stock assessments [@Gerritsen2007;@MinteVera2016]. Furthermore, in some mixed fisheries, the species composition of the catch in weight may be estimated from the conversion of samples of fish size [@Pianet2000; @Duparc2020], with potential major impacts on the estimates of species-specific catches if length-weight relationships are biased [@Marsac2017].

Purse seine fishing has represented about 70% of the global tropical tuna catch over the last decade, with an estimate of more than 3.6 million metric tons in 2019. In the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, the purse seine catch of the principal market tunas, yellowfin tuna (_Thunnus albacares_), skipjack tuna (_Katsuwonus pelamis_) and bigeye tuna (_Thunnus obesus_), was close to 800,000 metric tons in recent years. The species composition of most purse seine catch of the Indian and Atlantic is estimated from size samples of the catch performed during unloading operations that mainly take place in the ports of Abidjan (CÃ´te d'Ivoire), Dakar (Senegal), and Victoria (Seychelles) [@Pianet2000]. The collection of morphometric data on tuna has been implemented in these landing ports as early as the 1970s to derive the length-length and length-weight relationships required for the monitoring of purse seine fisheries occurring in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans [@Caveriviere1976; @Parks1982; @Cayre1986; @Marsac2006; @Chassot2016; @Diaha2016]. Unfortunately, most raw morphometric data collected on tropical tunas in the eastern Atlantic Ocean prior to the 2000s have been lost and the current reference length-weight relationships available at ICCAT have not been updated since the early 1980s ([ICCAT 1999](https://www.iccat.int/Documents/SCRS/Manual/Appendices/Appendix%204%20III%20Trop.pdf)).

The overarching objective of the present study is to derive robust relationships between pre-dorsal length, fork length, and round weight for the principal market tropical tunas caught with purse seine in the Atlantic and Indian oceans based on a large set of morphometric data collected through several research projects and monitoring programs covering more than four decades. We adopt a Bayesian statistical framework to analyse the variability in the morphometric relationships and assess the influence of sex and variation in space and time on the allometric factors of tropical tuna. The model aims to represent the full uncertainty in morphometric measurements XX.

<!-- Estimates of the condition factor and allometry coefficient can be related to ecological processes and life history. High values of the allometry coefficient imply that the species gains weight fast growing in length. The value of the coefficient estimated for a species can vary between stocks and even between areas Andrade & Campos 2002 -->
