## Statistical models

We used mean linear regression models to examine the relationships between _L~D~_ and _L~F~_, _L~D~_ and _W~R~_, and _L~F~_ and _W~R~_. First, we included gender (_G_), Longhurst province (_P_), type of school association (i.e., free-swimming school or school associated with drifting floating objects; _A_), and season (_S_) defined by the quarter of capture as categorical covariates in each model to assess their influence on the relationships between morphometric traits. Second, the models were only fitted to the length and weight data. The three full models fitted to the morphometric data were:

$$L_F_i = L_D_i + G + P + A + S + \epsilon_i$$
$$log_{10}(W_R_i) = log_{10}(L_D_i) + G + P + A + S + \delta_i$$
$$log_{10}(W_R_i) = log_{10}(L_F_i) + G + P + A + S + \gamma_i$$
Where the model residuals $\epsilon_i$, $\delta_i$, and $\gamma_i$ were assumed to be independent and identically distributed normal random variables with mean zero and constant variance. When modelling _W~R~_, we log10-transformed the variables to represent the assumption that measurement errors in weights are multiplicative. Predictions of the parameters accounted for bias due to log10-transformation [@Smith1993]. Assumptions of homoscedasticity and Gaussian distribution were checked through the residuals. Models were evaluated using the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Statistical analyses were performed in R version 4.1.0 (R Core Team, 2022).
