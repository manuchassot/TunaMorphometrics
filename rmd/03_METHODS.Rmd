## Statistical models

Mean linear regression models were fitted to the log-transformed variables: observed weights are log-normally distributed and multiplicative. Lognormal error to justify. 

Linear regression results in a bias due to the logarithmic transformation: the model passes through the geometric mean, rather than the arithmetic mean, but this can be adjusted using a simple correction factor (Sprugel, 1983)
