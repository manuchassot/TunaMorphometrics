  abstract  = {Tuna are marine apex predators that inhabit the tropical and sub-tropical waters of the Indian Ocean where they support socially and economically important fisheries. Key component of pelagic communities, tuna are bioindicator species of anthropogenic and climate-induced changes through modifications of the structure and related energy-flow of food webs and ecosystems. The IndianEcoTuna dataset provides a panel of ecological tracers measured in four soft tissues (white muscle, red muscle, liver, gonads) from 1,364 individuals of four species, i.e., the albacore (ALB, Thunnus alalunga), the bigeye (BET, T.-obesus), the skipjack (SKJ, Katsuwomus pelamis), and the yellowfin (YFT, T.-albacares), collected throughout the western Indian Ocean from 2009 to 2015. Sampling was carried out during routine monitoring programs, at sea by observers onboard professional vessels or at landing. For each record, the type of fishing gear, the conservation mode, as well as the fishing date and catch location are provided. Individuals were sampled to span a wide range of body sizes: 565 ALB with fork length from 58 to 118-cm, 155 BET from 29.5 to 173-cm, 304 SKJ from 30 to 74-cm, and 340 YFT from 29 to 171.5-cm. The IndianEcoTuna dataset combines: (1) 9,512 records of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (percent element weights, -13C and -15N values) in 1,185 fish, (2) 887 concentrations of total proteins in 242 fish, (3) 8,356 concentrations of total lipids and three lipid classes (triacylglycerols TAG; phospholipids PL; sterols ST) in 695 fish, and (4) 1,150 and 1,033 profiles of neutral and polar fatty acids in 397 and 342 fish, respectively. Information on sex and weights of the whole fish, gonads, liver and stomach is provided. Because of the essential trophic role and wide-ranging of tuna in marine systems, and the large panel of tropho-energetic tracers and derived-key quantitative parameters provided (e.g., niche width, trophic position, condition indices), the IndianEcoTuna dataset should be of high interest for global and regional research on marine trophic ecology and food web analysis, as well as on the impacts of anthropogenic changes on Indian Ocean marine ecosystems.

Eight forms of index were identified which can be categorized into those which measure the condition of individual fish, i.e. condition factors', and those which measure the condition of subpopulations as a whole, i.e. regressions of log, 10 weight on log, 10 length and the parameters of such regressions. Analysis of a test data set indicated that both the form of index and properties of the data set size can dictate the patterns of condition observed. The various indices were reviewed in terms of appropriateness, simplicity and statistical correctness. It was concluded that an index should be selected only after a detailed examination of both the underlying assumptions of the index and the properties of the data set.},

The present dataset pooling observations for 1984-2006 by observers at sea and at the cannery in Seychelles allows updating some of the biometric relationships used by the IOTC for yellowfin tuna. The updated equations proposed to convert first dorsal lengths into fork lengths is : FL = 2.0759 FDL1.1513. The updated size weight relationship proposed is : W = 1.8860E-05 FL3.0195 . The length at first maturity is re-estimated to 104 cm (for females) from a large dataset concerning the WIO purse seine fishery. A decrease of the size at which males become dominant in the population is suggested, from 154 cm to 144 cm in the present study. The analysis of gut contents points out clear distinction between areas covered by the purse seine fishery, in terms of dominance of prey resources for pelagic top predators.},

  abstract  = {Recent stock assessments of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) have shown a prominent residual pattern in size frequency for the Japanese longline fishery. The pattern consists of positive residuals (observations larger than model predictions) for medium-size fish (around 75-125 cm) in the late 1980s, shifting to larger fish (around 125-175 cm) after 1990. The prominent residual pattern was partially improved, but not eliminated, by implementing new spatial definitions for the longline fishery, based on uniformity in historical trends of catch per unit of effort (CPUE) and size data, and time-varying selectivity for the longline fisheries. As the size data of the longline fishery in these stock assessments were Japanese, the Japanese longline fishery seems to have suddenly begun catching larger fish after 1990. Therefore, collaborative work between IATTC and Japan was carried out to address the problem. In preliminary investigations, similar differences in size composition were also detected for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). Three hypotheses to explain this size-composition shift are developed: 1) change in Japanese longline fishing strategies, such as selection of fishing ground and/or fishing season between the two periods (pre- and post-1990), 2) development of new fishing gear that affected the sizes of tuna caught around 1990, and 3) change in the size data collecting and reporting system around 1990. Regarding the first hypothesis, the number of hooks of the Japanese longline fishery in the EPO had reached its highest historical level in 1991, after which it decreased, with some fluctuations, and the effort of the fishery became more concentrated in specific areas. However, the shift of the size composition occurred in all areas for both species (bigeye and yellowfin), thus the change in the spatial distribution of effort is not considered to have caused the shift. The difference in the seasonality of the effort between the two periods (pre- and post-1990) was less than 1\%, which indicates that the fishing schedule by quarter had not changed around 1990. Regarding the second hypothesis, mainlines made of nylon began to be deployed around 1990 by smaller Japanese longline vessels operating in the vicinity of Japan, and their use spread rapidly throughout this fishery. However, the new gear was unlikely to be popular with the larger longline vessels in the EPO around 1990, according to interviews with fishermen and given that logbook data show that the proportion of longline sets using nylon mainlines was only about 50\% in 1994. In addition, there was no strong evidence that the material of the main line affects the fish size composition. Regarding the third hypothesis, there were two items to be investigated, the vessel type (commercial vessel and training vessel) and the unit of fish size (weight or length). Although the average size of fish caught by the commercial vessels was larger than those of the training vessels in many cases, the ratio of sample size by vessel type was similar between the two periods (prior- and post 1990). Therefore, the difference in fish size by vessel type did not directly affect the size compostion shift in 1990. However, it is important to update the Japanese longline size data with the information about the vessel type for modeling the fishery’s selectivity, since there are clear differences in size compostion between the vessel types. As for the other component of the third hypothesis, until 2010 the raw weight data were converted to length before being submitted to the IATTC by the Japanese National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries (NRIFSF). The average fish lengths converted from the weight group were smaller than those of the length group in many cases, which indicated that the weight-length conversion caused an underestimation of fish size. The number of length measurements increased after 1990 for both species, and exceeded, or was equal to, the number of weight measurements in 1991, and since then the length measurements has predominated. However, the changes of the average weight for both species did not present a clear shift in 1990. This indicates that the shift in size composition in 1990 for both species is unlikely to represent a real change in fish size. The combined effects of the change in the data-collecting system and the underestimation of fish size from the weight-length conversion probably lead to an artificial shift in the size composition. It is important to update Japanese size data with the information about the unit of measurement. The informative size data is useful for investigating the previously-developed stock assessment models with two time blocks, new fishery definitions, and selectivity.},

However, this information is key to understanding the reproductive potential and resilience of the stock. We investigate how energetic resources are allocated for reproduction by female yellowfin tuna according to their size in the Gulf of Guinea (central-eastern Atlantic Ocean). Our results reveal that larger females have not only larger ovaries by virtue of their greater abdominal cavity, but also different fatty acid profiles in the gonads compared to smaller females, with potential effects on their spawning and recruitment patterns. This study contributes to the knowledge of size-dependent variation in female yellowfin tuna and paves the way for future studies on size-dependent effects on reproductive parameters in this species.},

  abstract = {ENGLISH: Results of a study of the length-weight relationships of yellowfin (Neothunnus macropterus) and skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) tuna from several fishing areas of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean have been published by Chatwin (1959). In that report, a very low exponential value of 2.6261 was obtained for skipjack from Area 14 (off northern Chile, see Chatwin, Figure 1). It was pointed out, however, that this estimate was based on two samples of fish with a very narrow range of total lengths, not representative of the range in the catch, and that it would be desirable to obtain a further estimate based on a larger range of total lengths. In addition, there proved to be significantly large differences among exponents for the areas sampled, precluding use of a single regression equation for all areas. Two important fishing areas remained unsampled (Areas 10 and 13, see Chatwin, Figure 1), and it appeared desirable to collect length-weight measurement data from them, so that estimating equations would be available for all areas. Subsequent to publication of Chatwin's study, samples of skipjack length-weight measurements were obtained from the desired areas. Estimates derived from these data, and their effects on the previous analysis are presented herein.SPANISH:Los resultados de un estudio sobre las relaciones entre la longitud y el peso del atún aleta amarilla (Neothunnus macropterus) y del barrilete (Katsuwonus pelamis) de las diferentes áreas de pesca en el Pacífico Oriental Tropical ya han sido publicados por Chatwin (1959). En ese informe se obtuvo un valor exponencial muy bajo de 2.626 para el barrilete del Area 14 (frente a la costa norte de Chile, ver Chatwin, Figura 1). Se hizo hincapié, sin embargo, en que esta estimación se basaba en dos muestras de peces con una amplitud muy estrecha de longitudes totales, no representativa de la amplitud en la pesca, y que sería deseable obtener una estimación adicional basada en una amplitud mayor de longitudes totales. Además, se comprobó que habian diferencias significativamente grandes entre los exponentes de las áreas muestreadas lo que impedía el usa de una sola ecuación de regresión para todas las áreas. Se quedaron sin muestrear dos importantes áreas de pesca (Areas 10 y 13, ver Chatwin, Figura 1) y pareció deseable recolectar datos de medidas de longitud y peso de estas áreas, de tal manera que hubiesen disponibles ecuaciones estimadoras para todas las áreas. Después de la publicación del estudio de Chatwin, so obtuvieron muestras de medidas de longitud y peso de barriletes de las áreas deseadas. Las estimaciones derivadas de estos datos y sus efectos sabre el análisis previo se dan en el presente informe.},

the Palau Island area. Kawasaki (1955) estimated
the growth of skipjack from the south western sea off
Japan, based on the progression of modal groups.
In a later publication Kawasaki (1963) gave additional
estimates of growth rates based on the data from the
area off north eastern Japan. Yokota et al. (1961)
estimated the growth rates based on modal progression
of skipjack from the Sulu Sea. Brock (1954) studied
the growth of skipjack in the area of the Hawaiian
islands by examining the progression of modes computed
from length frequency studies. Rothschild (1967)
estimated the parameters of growth for this species
on the basis of 35 recoveries of fish tagged in Hawaiian
waters -in 1958 which were at liberty upto 420 days.
In the eastern Pacific, Schaefer et al. (1961) examined
the growth of skipjack tagged during 1955-1959.},

An analysis of the physical characteristics of the Skipjack tuna suggests that its shape can be broken down into three main sections: the head, the center, and the tail. The central section of Skipjack tuna can be considered a barrel shape with an elliptical cross section, whereas the head and tail can be considered cones with elliptical bases. Linear regression analyses between fish weight and other geometric properties revealed a significant correlation (R2 = 0.74–0.97) to volume, projected area (side and top view), length, width (measured at the thickest part), and perimeter (measured at the thickest part). The results from this systematic analysis could be used in the design of new processes and equipment for Skipjack tuna processing.},

northern Andhra Pradesh along the east coast of India at depths of 200m and more is being
gainfully exploited by the local fishers since 2002. Hooks and lines as well as trolls operated
mostly from non-mechanized crafts (catamaran) are the major exploitation methods used. The
mechanized sector ventured into oceanic tuna fishing during 2006 with the conversion of a few
existing mechanized trawlers into long liners and for large scale commercial exploitation of
yellowfin tuna in this region. The average annual (2004-2006) landing of tuna by the catamaran
at Visakhapatnam was 1,515t. A wide size group represented the fishery with the fork length of
T.albacares measuring from 25 cm to 190 cm with major modes at 90 and 130 cm. Fishes above
80 cm were found to be mature and the size at first maturity was estimated to be between 90-95
cm. Males were dominant with a male: female ratio of 1: 0.58. The length weight relationship is
given by the formula W= 0.008634L 3.12. Food contents consisted of a variety of prey animals.
Fishes (bony pelagic fishes), crustaceans (crabs and shrimps) and molluscs (squids) were the
major prey groups. The fishery is still in its infancy and more research has to be carried out to
understand its biology and formulate proper management measures to sustainably harvest this
stock.},

In previous analyses, simplifying assumptions have been made in order to ease this intractability, but assumptions of this nature are unfortunate and restrictive. In this paper, we analyse errors-in-variables models in full generality under a Bayesian formulation. In order to compute the necessary posterior distributions, we utilize various computational techniques. Two specific non-linear errors-in-variables regression examples are considered; the first is a re-analysed Berkson-type model, and the second is a classical errors-in-variables model. Our analyses are compared and contrasted with those presented else-where in the literature.},

  abstract   = {During the last decade vessel-position-recording devices, such as the Vessel Monitoring System and the Automatic Identification System, have increasingly given accurate spatial and quantitative information of industrial fisheries. On the other hand, small-scale fisheries (vessels below 12 m) remain untracked and largely unregulated even though they play an important socio-economic and cultural role in European waters and coastal communities and account for most of the total EU fishing fleet. The typically low-technological capacity of these small-scale fishing boats—for which space and power onboard are often limited—as well their reduced operative range encourage the development of efficient, low-cost, and low-burden tracking solutions. In this context, we designed a cost-effective and scalable prototypic architecture to gather and process positional data from small-scale vessels, making use of a LoRaWAN/cellular network. Data collected by our first installation are presented, as well as its preliminary processing. The emergence of a such low-cost and open-source technology coupled to artificial intelligence could open new opportunities for equipping small-scale vessels, collecting their trajectory data, and estimating their fishing effort (information which has historically not been present). It enables a new monitoring strategy that could effectively include small-scale fleets and support the design of new policies oriented to inform coastal resource and fisheries management.},

  abstract = {Skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis, were collected from charter fishing boats operating from Hatteras and Oregon Inlet, North Carolina, from June–August for the years 1964–1965. Length-weight data were subdivided by year, area, and sex; and analysis of covariance indicated that one regression equation adequately described this relationship. Dorsal spine cross-sections were employed to assign absolute ages to the skipjack tuna. It was concluded that rings observed on the spine cross-sections were growth-marks, and that the growth-marks were annuli. Of 558 spine sections, 46 or 8.2\% were unreadable. Back-calculated lengths were determined from spine radius measurements by direct proportion. At the end of the first year the average fish length was 406 mm, 2nd year—493 mm, 3rd year—569 mm, and 4th year—638 mm. Asymptotic length and growth rate was estimated to be 872 mm (K=0.154) and 784 mm (K=0.195) for males and females. Mean lengths of fish of each age group were well separated; yet a great deal of overlap existed in the ranges. This was attributed to the relatively rapid-growing, short-lived fish. Length data were subdivided according to year, area, and sex. Analysis of variance of these data indicated a statistically significant difference between years and areas, but not between sexes. This was attributed to the differences in the age composition of the skipjack tuna collected at Hatteras and Oregon Inlet.},

  abstract = {It has been known for some time (DJ Finney, J. Roy. Stat. Soc. Suppl. 7:155–161, 1941) that transformation of an arithmetic data set to logarithms results in biased estimates when predicted values from a leastsquares regression are detransformed back to arithmetic units. Predicted values are estimates of the geometric mean of the dependent variable at that value of the independent variable, rather than the arithmetic mean. Since the geometric mean is always less than the arithmetic mean, detransformed predictions will underestimate the value in question. This bias affects the interpretations of allometric equations used for estimation, such as predicting fossil body mass from skeletal dimensions, and applications of allometry as a “criterion of subtraction,” in which residual variation is evaluated. A number of parametric and nonparametric corrections for transformation bias have been developed. Although this problem is relatively unexplored in mammalian morphometrics, it has received considerable attention in other disciplines that use power functions structurally identical to the allometric equation. Insights into transformation bias and the use of correction terms from economics, limnology, forestry, and hydrology are reviewed and interpreted for application to mammalian allometry. © 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

For some this is likely due to unfamiliarity or disagreement with the Bayesian inferential paradigm. For others a contributory factor is the inability of standard statistical packages to perform such Bayesian analyses. In this paper, we first give an overview of the Bayesian approach to handling covariate measurement error, and contrast it with regression calibration, arguably the most commonly adopted approach. We then argue why the Bayesian approach has a number of statistical advantages compared to regression calibration and demonstrate that implementing the Bayesian approach is usually quite feasible for the analyst. Next, we describe the closely related maximum likelihood and multiple imputation approaches and explain why we believe the Bayesian approach to generally be preferable. We then empirically compare the frequentist properties of regression calibration and the Bayesian approach through simulation studies. The flexibility of the Bayesian approach to handle both measurement error and missing data is then illustrated through an analysis of data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.},

The fork length and weight of a total of 1678 specimens were measured. The results showed that the fork length of more than 70\% of specimens was below 60 cm (76\% in AS09, 87\% in ND12, and 73\% in JJ13). The coefficient b in the combined sex group was 3.367, 3.300 and 3.234 in JJ13, AS09 and ND12, respectively. The b values of WLRs when fork length was {\textgreater}60 cm were significantly less than 3 (P = 0.062), but when fork length was {\textless}60 cm they were significantly greater than 3 (P = 0.028). The K value ranges of JJ13, AS09 and ND12 in different fork length groups were 1.3–1.84 (1.62 ± 0.18), 1.57–2.02 (1.86 ± 0.15), and 1.44–1.78 (0.65 ± 0.13), respectively. Moreover, K values in different fork length classes for each cruise had one turning point: 60–65 cm for JJ13; 60–65 cm for ND12; and 55–60 cm for AS09. The results of this study provide basic information on the WLRs and K values of skipjack tuna in different seasons and growth phases in the WCPO, which are useful for fishery biologists and fishery managers.},

  abstract = {In most fishery analysis, a size-frequency sample of fish needs to be raised to estimate the size frequency of all fish caught by the boat. This process is usually approached by building a raising factor which is the ratio between the total catch weight and the weight of the sample measured to obtain the size frequency. Estimates of the sample’s weight can be obtained by using a length–weight relationship equation, and the sampled size frequency. Although, the parameters of the length–weight relationship could vary in time (e.g. by month), so the use of a single equation to build raising factors throughout the year could introduce a bias in the raised estimates of catch-at-length. To investigate the monthly variation of the length–weight relationship parameters of skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), fish landed in Itajaı\&\#x0301;-SC harbor from May 1995 to June 1996 were sampled. Size frequencies sampled in 1997 were used as a case study in the investigation of the effect of monthly variation of parameters on the raising factors and in consequence, on the estimate of annual catch-at-length. Considering all data, regardless the month of the sample, the estimated length–weight relationship for the skipjack tuna was weight(kg)=6.54E−06×length(cm)3.29. There were monthly variations on the allometry coefficient (exponent of the power equation). However, the differences between the coefficient obtained for the grouped data and for each month were not significant in 50\% of the cases. The differences between the estimated catch-at-length by using both a general length–weight relationship equation (all data) and several monthly equations, were low and not significant.},

Additionally, condition indices were estimated for individual fish and for length-frequency samples in order to summarise the length–weight relationships. The length–weight regression showed a significant area effect but no significant differences existed between the sexes. The condition indices showed a moderate spatial structure for both species: around 25\% of the variability could be explained by the location of the samples, the rest of the variability was due to other sources. Length–weight relationships did not appear to vary significantly within stocks, however differences between stocks were significant. In the present case, a bias of up to 10\% could occur in biomass estimates as a result of applying length–weight relationships of one stock to length data of a neighbouring stock.},

  abstract = {1. The methods of analysing length-weight data from fish are reviewed. Emphasis is laid on empirical formulae of the type W = aLn, and the limitations of the conventional condition factor. 2. The length-weight relationship of perch of all sizes was determined from a series of regressions of log weight on log length, and an analysis of covariance. Relative condition factors were calculated for individual fish from smoothed mean weights obtained from the regression lines. 3. In length-weight relationship it was found that the perch could be divided into a series of six groups corresponding with age, sex and maturity. Each group was generally homogeneous within itself throughout the seasons, but usually differed significantly from the other groups. Relative condition was found to vary significantly with the season. 4. At any one season the gonad weight is a constant percentage of the body weight for fish of all sizes. The seasonal changes in gonad weight are described and differ somewhat for the two sexes. Stomach contents weigh up to 2\% of the body weight in summer. 5. There is a regular seasonal cycle in condition which is at its maximum in September and minimum in early spring. The different seasonal changes in condition between mature and immature fish can largely be accounted for by the cycle in gonad weight of the former.},
