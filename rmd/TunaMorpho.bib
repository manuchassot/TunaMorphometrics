  abstract = {A survey of the studies published in two leading fisheries journals revealed that the analysis and measurement of condition, based on length-weight data, has been performed using a wide variety of indices and statistical procedures. Eight forms of index were identified which can be categorized into those which measure the condition of individual fish, i.e. condition factors', and those which measure the condition of subpopulations as a whole, i.e. regressions of log, 10 weight on log, 10 length and the parameters of such regressions. Analysis of a test data set indicated that both the form of index and properties of the data set size can dictate the patterns of condition observed. The various indices were reviewed in terms of appropriateness, simplicity and statistical correctness. It was concluded that an index should be selected only after a detailed examination of both the underlying assumptions of the index and the properties of the data set.},

  abstract  = {Recent stock assessments of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) have shown a prominent residual pattern in size frequency for the Japanese longline fishery. The pattern consists of positive residuals (observations larger than model predictions) for medium-size fish (around 75-125 cm) in the late 1980s, shifting to larger fish (around 125-175 cm) after 1990. The prominent residual pattern was partially improved, but not eliminated, by implementing new spatial definitions for the longline fishery, based on uniformity in historical trends of catch per unit of effort (CPUE) and size data, and time-varying selectivity for the longline fisheries. As the size data of the longline fishery in these stock assessments were Japanese, the Japanese longline fishery seems to have suddenly begun catching larger fish after 1990. Therefore, collaborative work between IATTC and Japan was carried out to address the problem. In preliminary investigations, similar differences in size composition were also detected for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). Three hypotheses to explain this size-composition shift are developed: 1) change in Japanese longline fishing strategies, such as selection of fishing ground and/or fishing season between the two periods (pre- and post-1990), 2) development of new fishing gear that affected the sizes of tuna caught around 1990, and 3) change in the size data collecting and reporting system around 1990. Regarding the first hypothesis, the number of hooks of the Japanese longline fishery in the EPO had reached its highest historical level in 1991, after which it decreased, with some fluctuations, and the effort of the fishery became more concentrated in specific areas. However, the shift of the size composition occurred in all areas for both species (bigeye and yellowfin), thus the change in the spatial distribution of effort is not considered to have caused the shift. The difference in the seasonality of the effort between the two periods (pre- and post-1990) was less than 1\%, which indicates that the fishing schedule by quarter had not changed around 1990. Regarding the second hypothesis, mainlines made of nylon began to be deployed around 1990 by smaller Japanese longline vessels operating in the vicinity of Japan, and their use spread rapidly throughout this fishery. However, the new gear was unlikely to be popular with the larger longline vessels in the EPO around 1990, according to interviews with fishermen and given that logbook data show that the proportion of longline sets using nylon mainlines was only about 50\% in 1994. In addition, there was no strong evidence that the material of the main line affects the fish size composition. Regarding the third hypothesis, there were two items to be investigated, the vessel type (commercial vessel and training vessel) and the unit of fish size (weight or length). Although the average size of fish caught by the commercial vessels was larger than those of the training vessels in many cases, the ratio of sample size by vessel type was similar between the two periods (prior- and post 1990). Therefore, the difference in fish size by vessel type did not directly affect the size compostion shift in 1990. However, it is important to update the Japanese longline size data with the information about the vessel type for modeling the fishery’s selectivity, since there are clear differences in size compostion between the vessel types. As for the other component of the third hypothesis, until 2010 the raw weight data were converted to length before being submitted to the IATTC by the Japanese National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries (NRIFSF). The average fish lengths converted from the weight group were smaller than those of the length group in many cases, which indicated that the weight-length conversion caused an underestimation of fish size. The number of length measurements increased after 1990 for both species, and exceeded, or was equal to, the number of weight measurements in 1991, and since then the length measurements has predominated. However, the changes of the average weight for both species did not present a clear shift in 1990. This indicates that the shift in size composition in 1990 for both species is unlikely to represent a real change in fish size. The combined effects of the change in the data-collecting system and the underestimation of fish size from the weight-length conversion probably lead to an artificial shift in the size composition. It is important to update Japanese size data with the information about the unit of measurement. The informative size data is useful for investigating the previously-developed stock assessment models with two time blocks, new fishery definitions, and selectivity.},

  abstract   = {Length–weight relationships of fish are often used to estimate the biomass of length distributions or to obtain indices of condition. Although large-scale spatial trends are known to exist, it is often assumed that length–weight relationships do not vary significantly within stocks or between neighbouring stocks. The present study examined length–weight relationships of 1334 haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and 1186 whiting (Merlangius merlangus) collected on a groundfish survey in the waters around Ireland in 2004. Additionally, condition indices were estimated for individual fish and for length-frequency samples in order to summarise the length–weight relationships. The length–weight regression showed a significant area effect but no significant differences existed between the sexes. The condition indices showed a moderate spatial structure for both species: around 25\% of the variability could be explained by the location of the samples, the rest of the variability was due to other sources. Length–weight relationships did not appear to vary significantly within stocks, however differences between stocks were significant. In the present case, a bias of up to 10\% could occur in biomass estimates as a result of applying length–weight relationships of one stock to length data of a neighbouring stock.},

Emphasis is laid on empirical formulae of the type W = aLn, and the limitations of the conventional condition factor. 2. The length-weight relationship of perch of all sizes was determined from a series of regressions of log weight on log length, and an analysis of covariance. Relative condition factors were calculated for individual fish from smoothed mean weights obtained from the regression lines. 3. In length-weight relationship it was found that the perch could be divided into a series of six groups corresponding with age, sex and maturity. Each group was generally homogeneous within itself throughout the seasons, but usually differed significantly from the other groups. Relative condition was found to vary significantly with the season. 4. At any one season the gonad weight is a constant percentage of the body weight for fish of all sizes. The seasonal changes in gonad weight are described and differ somewhat for the two sexes. Stomach contents weigh up to 2\% of the body weight in summer. 5. There is a regular seasonal cycle in condition which is at its maximum in September and minimum in early spring. The different seasonal changes in condition between mature and immature fish can largely be accounted for by the cycle in gonad weight of the former.},

The results further indicated that the LLRs were highly correlated (r2 {\textgreater} 0.989, P {\textless} 0.001). The monthly gonadosomatic index showed that the reproductive period of M. vittatus began in April, and ended in August when the highest values of the Fulton's condition factor (K) indicated their recovery.
