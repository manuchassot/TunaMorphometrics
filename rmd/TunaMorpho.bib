  abstract  = {This paper aims to demonstrate the great potential of routine sampling at canneries to follow up biological parameters of tuna species and to track changes (in space and time) of the forage resources available to pelagic top predators. The present dataset pooling observations for 1984-2006 by observers at sea and at the cannery in Seychelles allows updating some of the biometric relationships used by the IOTC for yellowfin tuna. The updated equations proposed to convert first dorsal lengths into fork lengths is : FL = 2.0759 FDL1.1513. The updated size weight relationship proposed is : W = 1.8860E-05 FL3.0195 . The length at first maturity is re-estimated to 104 cm (for females) from a large dataset concerning the WIO purse seine fishery. A decrease of the size at which males become dominant in the population is suggested, from 154 cm to 144 cm in the present study. The analysis of gut contents points out clear distinction between areas covered by the purse seine fishery, in terms of dominance of prey resources for pelagic top predators.},

Eight forms of index were identified which can be categorized into those which measure the condition of individual fish, i.e. condition factors', and those which measure the condition of subpopulations as a whole, i.e. regressions of log, 10 weight on log, 10 length and the parameters of such regressions. Analysis of a test data set indicated that both the form of index and properties of the data set size can dictate the patterns of condition observed. The various indices were reviewed in terms of appropriateness, simplicity and statistical correctness. It was concluded that an index should be selected only after a detailed examination of both the underlying assumptions of the index and the properties of the data set.},

  abstract  = {Recent stock assessments of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) have shown a prominent residual pattern in size frequency for the Japanese longline fishery. The pattern consists of positive residuals (observations larger than model predictions) for medium-size fish (around 75-125 cm) in the late 1980s, shifting to larger fish (around 125-175 cm) after 1990. The prominent residual pattern was partially improved, but not eliminated, by implementing new spatial definitions for the longline fishery, based on uniformity in historical trends of catch per unit of effort (CPUE) and size data, and time-varying selectivity for the longline fisheries. As the size data of the longline fishery in these stock assessments were Japanese, the Japanese longline fishery seems to have suddenly begun catching larger fish after 1990. Therefore, collaborative work between IATTC and Japan was carried out to address the problem. In preliminary investigations, similar differences in size composition were also detected for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares). Three hypotheses to explain this size-composition shift are developed: 1) change in Japanese longline fishing strategies, such as selection of fishing ground and/or fishing season between the two periods (pre- and post-1990), 2) development of new fishing gear that affected the sizes of tuna caught around 1990, and 3) change in the size data collecting and reporting system around 1990. Regarding the first hypothesis, the number of hooks of the Japanese longline fishery in the EPO had reached its highest historical level in 1991, after which it decreased, with some fluctuations, and the effort of the fishery became more concentrated in specific areas. However, the shift of the size composition occurred in all areas for both species (bigeye and yellowfin), thus the change in the spatial distribution of effort is not considered to have caused the shift. The difference in the seasonality of the effort between the two periods (pre- and post-1990) was less than 1\%, which indicates that the fishing schedule by quarter had not changed around 1990. Regarding the second hypothesis, mainlines made of nylon began to be deployed around 1990 by smaller Japanese longline vessels operating in the vicinity of Japan, and their use spread rapidly throughout this fishery. However, the new gear was unlikely to be popular with the larger longline vessels in the EPO around 1990, according to interviews with fishermen and given that logbook data show that the proportion of longline sets using nylon mainlines was only about 50\% in 1994. In addition, there was no strong evidence that the material of the main line affects the fish size composition. Regarding the third hypothesis, there were two items to be investigated, the vessel type (commercial vessel and training vessel) and the unit of fish size (weight or length). Although the average size of fish caught by the commercial vessels was larger than those of the training vessels in many cases, the ratio of sample size by vessel type was similar between the two periods (prior- and post 1990). Therefore, the difference in fish size by vessel type did not directly affect the size compostion shift in 1990. However, it is important to update the Japanese longline size data with the information about the vessel type for modeling the fishery’s selectivity, since there are clear differences in size compostion between the vessel types. As for the other component of the third hypothesis, until 2010 the raw weight data were converted to length before being submitted to the IATTC by the Japanese National Research Institute of Far Seas Fisheries (NRIFSF). The average fish lengths converted from the weight group were smaller than those of the length group in many cases, which indicated that the weight-length conversion caused an underestimation of fish size. The number of length measurements increased after 1990 for both species, and exceeded, or was equal to, the number of weight measurements in 1991, and since then the length measurements has predominated. However, the changes of the average weight for both species did not present a clear shift in 1990. This indicates that the shift in size composition in 1990 for both species is unlikely to represent a real change in fish size. The combined effects of the change in the data-collecting system and the underestimation of fish size from the weight-length conversion probably lead to an artificial shift in the size composition. It is important to update Japanese size data with the information about the unit of measurement. The informative size data is useful for investigating the previously-developed stock assessment models with two time blocks, new fishery definitions, and selectivity.},

  abstract  = {Tuna are marine apex predators that inhabit the tropical and sub-tropical waters of the Indian Ocean where they support socially and economically important fisheries. Key component of pelagic communities, tuna are bioindicator species of anthropogenic and climate-induced changes through modifications of the structure and related energy-flow of food webs and ecosystems. The IndianEcoTuna dataset provides a panel of ecological tracers measured in four soft tissues (white muscle, red muscle, liver, gonads) from 1,364 individuals of four species, i.e., the albacore (ALB, Thunnus alalunga), the bigeye (BET, T.-obesus), the skipjack (SKJ, Katsuwomus pelamis), and the yellowfin (YFT, T.-albacares), collected throughout the western Indian Ocean from 2009 to 2015. Sampling was carried out during routine monitoring programs, at sea by observers onboard professional vessels or at landing. For each record, the type of fishing gear, the conservation mode, as well as the fishing date and catch location are provided. Individuals were sampled to span a wide range of body sizes: 565 ALB with fork length from 58 to 118-cm, 155 BET from 29.5 to 173-cm, 304 SKJ from 30 to 74-cm, and 340 YFT from 29 to 171.5-cm. The IndianEcoTuna dataset combines: (1) 9,512 records of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes (percent element weights, -13C and -15N values) in 1,185 fish, (2) 887 concentrations of total proteins in 242 fish, (3) 8,356 concentrations of total lipids and three lipid classes (triacylglycerols TAG; phospholipids PL; sterols ST) in 695 fish, and (4) 1,150 and 1,033 profiles of neutral and polar fatty acids in 397 and 342 fish, respectively. Information on sex and weights of the whole fish, gonads, liver and stomach is provided. Because of the essential trophic role and wide-ranging of tuna in marine systems, and the large panel of tropho-energetic tracers and derived-key quantitative parameters provided (e.g., niche width, trophic position, condition indices), the IndianEcoTuna dataset should be of high interest for global and regional research on marine trophic ecology and food web analysis, as well as on the impacts of anthropogenic changes on Indian Ocean marine ecosystems.

The present study examined length–weight relationships of 1334 haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and 1186 whiting (Merlangius merlangus) collected on a groundfish survey in the waters around Ireland in 2004. Additionally, condition indices were estimated for individual fish and for length-frequency samples in order to summarise the length–weight relationships. The length–weight regression showed a significant area effect but no significant differences existed between the sexes. The condition indices showed a moderate spatial structure for both species: around 25\% of the variability could be explained by the location of the samples, the rest of the variability was due to other sources. Length–weight relationships did not appear to vary significantly within stocks, however differences between stocks were significant. In the present case, a bias of up to 10\% could occur in biomass estimates as a result of applying length–weight relationships of one stock to length data of a neighbouring stock.},

  abstract = {1. The methods of analysing length-weight data from fish are reviewed. Emphasis is laid on empirical formulae of the type W = aLn, and the limitations of the conventional condition factor. 2. The length-weight relationship of perch of all sizes was determined from a series of regressions of log weight on log length, and an analysis of covariance. Relative condition factors were calculated for individual fish from smoothed mean weights obtained from the regression lines. 3. In length-weight relationship it was found that the perch could be divided into a series of six groups corresponding with age, sex and maturity. Each group was generally homogeneous within itself throughout the seasons, but usually differed significantly from the other groups. Relative condition was found to vary significantly with the season. 4. At any one season the gonad weight is a constant percentage of the body weight for fish of all sizes. The seasonal changes in gonad weight are described and differ somewhat for the two sexes. Stomach contents weigh up to 2\% of the body weight in summer. 5. There is a regular seasonal cycle in condition which is at its maximum in September and minimum in early spring. The different seasonal changes in condition between mature and immature fish can largely be accounted for by the cycle in gonad weight of the former.},

A total of 2438 specimens (3.60–9.60 cm standard length) used in this study was caught with traditional fishing gear from January to December 2004. Overall, the allometric coefficient b of the LWR was close to the isometric value (b = 3.058), although it suggested negative allometric growth for males (b = 2.959) whilst positive allometric growth for females (b = 3.134). The results further indicated that the LLRs were highly correlated (r2 {\textgreater} 0.989, P {\textless} 0.001). The monthly gonadosomatic index showed that the reproductive period of M. vittatus began in April, and ended in August when the highest values of the Fulton's condition factor (K) indicated their recovery. These results will be useful for fishery managers to impose adequate regulations for sustainable fishery management not only in the Mathabhanga River of Bangladesh but also in neighbouring countries.},
